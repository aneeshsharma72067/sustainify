            , a web and app developer from India, coming from pretty humble
            beginnings. So, I've always been into web development, and one day,
            I thought, "Hey, wouldn't it be cool to have a place where folks can
            share their ideas about what's up with our environment and how we
            can make it better?" So, I rolled up my sleeves and spent some
            quality time crafting this web app. It was actually my personal
            project, but deep down, I hope it could grow into something big,
            like an official platform for spreading awareness about our
            environment. I'm all about using tech to do some good in the world.
            And if this little project can help spark some conversations and
            actions towards a greener, healthier planet, well, that's what it's
            all about, right?
